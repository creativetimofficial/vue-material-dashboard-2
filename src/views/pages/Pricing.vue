                  It really matters and then like it really doesn’t matter. What
                  matters is the people who are sparked by it. And the people
                  who are like offended by it, it doesn’t matter. Because
                  it&#39;s motivating the doers. Because I’m here to follow my
                  dreams and and inspire other people to follow their dreams,
                  too.

                  The time is now for it to be okay to be great. People in this
                  world shun people for being great. For being a bright color.
                  For standing out. But the time is now to be okay to be the
                  greatest you. Would you believe in what you believe in, if you
                  were the only one who believed it? If everything I did failed
                  - which it doesn&#39;t, it actually succeeds - just the fact
                  that I&#39;m willing to fail is an inspiration. People are so
                  scared to lose that they don&#39;t even try. Like, one thing
                  people can&#39;t say is that I&#39;m not trying, and I&#39;m
                  not trying my hardest, and I&#39;m not trying to do the best
                  way I know how.

                  I always felt like I could do anything. That’s the main thing

                  themselves! They&#39;re slowed down by their perception of
                  themselves. If you&#39;re taught you can’t do anything, you
                  won’t do anything. I was taught I could do everything.

                  There’s nothing I really wanted to do in life that I wasn’t
                  able to get good at. That’s my skill. I’m not really

                  learn. That’s what I do. That’s what I’m here for. Don’t be
